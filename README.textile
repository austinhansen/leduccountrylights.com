h3. Development Setup

After checking on the repository just run the following two commands and answer the prompts.

<pre><code class='bash'>bundle install
bundle exec thor setup</code></pre>

I like to run guard while I develop to trigger the correct tests to run and browser reloads while
working on front end design and JavaScript.

<pre<code class='bash'>bundle exec guard</code></pre>
